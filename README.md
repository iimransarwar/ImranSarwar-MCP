# Salesforce MCP Server - Prompts

This guide provides sample prompts demonstrating how to interact with various MCP tools. Each tool is listed with a brief description and example prompts to illustrate its functionality.


## üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Best Practices

* **Request Focused Assistance:** When prompting Claude, instruct the MCP to only focus on what you've specifically asked for. This prevents unintended actions and keeps responses relevant.
* **Always Request Confirmation:** Tell Claude to always ask for explicit confirmation before making any changes to your Salesforce org. This provides an important safety check before modifications are applied.
* **Request Action Plans:** Ask Claude to create and present a plan of proposed changes before executing them. This allows you to review and approve the specific actions that will be taken in your org.
* **APEX Coding**: If you are asking it to write APEX code or LWC's, just add a line telling it not to attempt any deployments, unless you are using an IDE which can do so.
* **Example Prompt:** "Please analyze my custom objects, but before making any changes, show me a plan of what you're proposing to modify and wait for my approval."
